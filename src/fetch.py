"""
This CLI program fetches URLs and caches them locally in the current directory.
You can view these links offline, since all assets are archived.

Additionally, it gathers metadata on the fetched content and can provide that
information if invoked with the --meta-data switch.

It can also fetch multiple links at a time.
